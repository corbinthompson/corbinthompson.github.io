Now, he’s sharing his empowering story in song with his debut EP, aptly titled, Chapter One.</p><p>   “I left everything with a suitcase full of dreams because music is the one thing that I love the most in life,” shares the Vancouver, Canada-based artist “I want my journey to be an inspiration for every one out there who has a dream and is fighting hard to make it come true.”</p><p>   Chapter One is a powerful opening artistic salvo chock full of heartfelt pop-rock finely crafted with rousing hooks, sweetly raspy vocals, and uplifting, big dream stories with hugely triumphant outcomes. It’s an aesthetic that is both timeless and timely, conjuring influences as diverse as the Beatles, Bon Jovi, Elvis, Oasis, Arctic Monkeys, The Killers, and Guns N’ Roses. Corbin also draws outside these lines with a streak of artistic fearlessness, exploring tinges of EDM, bossa nova, and intimate singer-songwriter balladry.</p><p>   “I write about love and dreams, and those moments when you overcome obstacles,” he details. “I want the stories in my songs to inspire other people to pursue their dreams.”</p><p>   Corbin was born in Rio De Janeiro, but grew up in a quaint town outside the big city. His But his mother blasting Bon Jovi nonstop ensured Corbin was destined to be a rock singer, and, at 16, Corbin’s fate was sealed when he saw Bon Jovi live with his mother after an epic journey that involved an all-night bus ride. Hearing those songs come to life in the majesty of a stadium rewired Corbin.  “I fell in love. It was the most inspiring night in my life,” he recalls. </p><p>   It would be a while before Corbin could consider pursuing his dream. Seeing Bon Jovi onstage felt like seeing a bunch of touched people who won the lottery. The chances seemed so remote to play music, and the options slim, especially in his small town. He tried playing in bands, but found out that a lot of the local musicians didn’t share in his fire for the dream, and didn’t have the focus and discipline to build a world-class band.</p><p>   Frustrated and feeling lost, he found himself taking the route of a career in economics. It would be this time of bottoming out where Chapter One begins. This period spurred him to move to Vancouver, Canada, immerse himself in the scene, and reinvent his life on his own terms, as a full-time musician in a metropolis with a thriving music scene.  </p><p>Corbin’s debut EP is a stirring collection of heart-on-sleeve Tommy and Gina stories (“Living On a Prayer” reference here), lovelorn ballads, and heartfelt reflections.  His debut single, the haunting alt-rock ballad “Wasting Words,” snapshots the final debris of a love relationship. The track’s accompanying video captures a romance unraveling with panache and passion. In the video, Corbin cuts a sensitive badass profile clad in a black biker jacket with slick jet-black hair, singing with soulful vulnerability.  He revisits this bold emotionality on “White Flag,” the first original he ever recorded, a plea for peace directly inspired by the November 2015 Paris Attacks. </p><p>   One of Chapter One’s standouts is the autobiographical, “The Man I’ve Gotta Be,” a song of struggle between desires and responsibilities. It was written when Corbin was torn between what was expected of him, and what he wanted. Thankfully, in the end, he ended up becoming the man he wanted to be. In closing, Corbin says: “I don’t have a ‘Plan B,’ I’m giving it all for my dreams. For the first time in my life I can see where I want to go and how to get there.”</p>"
