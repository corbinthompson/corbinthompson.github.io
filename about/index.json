He grew up listening to Bon Jovi as the soundtrack to his childhood, along with The Beatles, Elvis and Guns N’ Roses - he was destined to be a rock star. At age 16, Corbin’s fate was sealed when he saw Bon Jovi live with his mother after an epic cross-country journey, “I fell in love. It was the most inspiring night in my life,” he recalls.</p><p>With a career in economics on the line, Hale made the decision to live his purpose, fled his small town, headed to Vancouver, Canada with nothing but a suitcase full of dreams and immersed himself in the music scene to reinvent himself - on his own terms. </p><p>Filled with heartfelt and finely-crafted hooks, raspy vocals and empowering lyrics, Corbin’s work has become a timeless and timely addition to rock music worldwide. It encapsulates the feelings of nostalgia with its old-school rock anthems and a modern twist with similar sounds of the Arctic Monkeys and The Killers. </p><p style=\"text-align: center;margin: 70px;\"><i>“I write about love, loss and life - those moments when you overcome obstacles. I want the stories in my songs to inspire other people to pursue their dreams.”<br> - Corbin Hale </i></p><p>His debut single, the haunting alt-rock ballad,<i> Wasting Words </i>, captures the final debris of a relationship ending. The track’s accompanying video illustrates a romance unraveling with panache and passion. </p><p>His second single, the infectious and ridiculously catchy pop-rock track <i>Blue Jeans </i> is a more light-hearted look into the young stud’s love life. Hale proudly takes a social stand as a peacekeeper and advocate for love with <i>White Flag</i>, the first original he ever recorded, a plea for peace directly inspired by the November 2015 Paris Attacks. </p><p>For a peek into Hale’s ambitious and more masculine side - <i>The Man I’ve Gotta Be</i> is his autobiographical track outlining his struggle between desires and responsibilities. It was written when Hale was torn between what was expected of him, and what he wanted. Thankfully, in the end, Corbin ended up becoming the man the wanted to be. In closing, he says: <i>\"I don’t have a ‘Plan B’, I’m giving it all for my dreams. For the first time in my life I can see where I want to go and how to get there.” </i></p><p>Available on on <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/2RO7djUmzilbneD45QWsGS\" target=\"_blank\">Spotify</a>, <a href=\"https://youtube.com/corbinhale\" target=\"_blank\">Youtube</a> and accessible across social media - keep your eyes and ears open for this guy. <!--Full width photo at the end--></p>"
