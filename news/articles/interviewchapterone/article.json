I wrote it in a history class years ago in a matter of minutes and it’s one of the rawest songs I ever wrote,” Hale stated about the piece.</span></p><p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"></span><br></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Several different versions of the track were recorded before the final audio was chosen. The first demo went in a more upbeat direction and a lower key; the second demo took a more acoustic approach. It took several more attempts and style changes before the singer-songwriter was fully satisfied with the outcome and had created a track that he knew was ready to be released.
