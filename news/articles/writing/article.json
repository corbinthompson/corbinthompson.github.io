Every video I made, picture I took, and verse I wrote had to be better than all of my previous works: \"Wasting Words\", \"She'll Never Come Home\", my entire EP....</p><p>After September, I had lost a lot of special people in my life and I began to question myself. How could I create something good without having these people to support me?</p><p>I’ve now realized that I can. I’m starting something new with my head held high. I’m proud of myself. What I’ve learned is not to wait for the perfect timing, the perfect melody, the perfect line, just start creating what you want to and it will all come together. I stopped caring so much about the effects and started to enjoy doing the things I love just because I love them, no other reason. It doesn’t matter how many likes or views you’ll get, or how many people are going to “approve” of what you do. Do things for you and start now.<!--Full width photo at the end--><img style=\"border: medium double rgb(174, 61, 22);width: 100%; margin-top: 20px;\" src=\"news/articles/writing/photo.jpg\"></p>"
