When you provide voice to the ones who have never been heard before… or when you realize you have provided a small change in someone else's life - it is priceless. My biggest dream is to inspire dreams and I think I have been doing that already little by little. This week, I have seen Daniel Mendes, who has special needs, laugh and have fun feeling accepted and loved; I have seen Agatha get emotional and face one of her biggest fears; I have helped Ana to follow a dream to become a professional dancer that she no longer believed in; I have given Juliana her first opportunity to appear on a video clip; I have seen people from different countries hug Igor and spread love for no reason. And I have also learned how strong Phyllip is and how much “Overtake my limits” means to him. This is love. This is friendship. I have never been happier to be alive. Thanks to everyone who have or haven’t been part of my video. You are my inspiration. </p><p><img style=\"border: medium double rgb(174, 61, 22);width: 100%; margin-top: 20px;\" src=\"news/articles/dreams/photo.png\"></p>"
