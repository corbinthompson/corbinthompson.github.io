It stands for the beginning of a dream that was once unlikely or maybe even impossible. It is beautiful to see how much we have grown since when we were just two kids in high school, trying to write songs about broken hearts in the middle of our classes (Just kidding, mom, we were studying hard ðŸ˜‚)</p><p class=\"indented\">Today, the verses written in our notebooks are starting to gain meaning and life. Something once laying in our creative minds is now becoming reality. Everything we dream and work hard in finds a way to us. Someway, somehow things happen. Sounds crazy? It is. I mean, what's the point of living if you don't go a little crazy? </p><p><img style=\"border: medium double rgb(174, 61, 22);width: 100%; margin-top: 20px;\" src=\"news/articles/newjourney/photo.JPG\"></p>"
