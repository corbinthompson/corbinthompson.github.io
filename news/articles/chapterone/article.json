The work is set to become a timeless and timely addition to rock music worldwide. It encapsulates the feelings of nostalgia with its old-school rock anthems and a modern twist with similar sounds of the Arctic Monkeys and The Killers. \fs25\fsmilli12800 \cf4 \strokec4 \\pard\pardeftab720\sl300\partightenfactor0\cf4 \\pard\pardeftab720\sl360\partightenfactor0\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 \strokec2 \'93\cf5 \strokec5 When I hold my first EP in my hands it takes me back to that one day I took the plane to Vancouver with nothing but dreams inside of my suitcase.

The track\'92s accompanying video illustrates a romance unraveling with panache and passion. \fs25\fsmilli12800 \cf4 \strokec4 \\pard\pardeftab720\sl300\partightenfactor0\cf4 \\pard\pardeftab720\sl360\partightenfactor0\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 \strokec2 His second single, the infectious and ridiculously catchy pop-rock track Blue Jeans is a more light-hearted look into the young stud\'92s love life. Hale proudly takes a social stand as a peacekeeper and advocate for love with White Flag, the first original he ever recorded, a plea for peace directly inspired by the November 2015 Paris Attacks. \fs25\fsmilli12800 \cf4 \strokec4 \\pard\pardeftab720\sl300\partightenfactor0\cf4 \\pard\pardeftab720\sl360\partightenfactor0\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 \strokec2 For a peek into Hale\'92s ambitious and more masculine side - The Man I\'92ve Gotta Be is his autobiographical track outlining his struggle between desires and responsibilities. It was written when Hale was torn between what was expected of him, and what he wanted. Thankfully, in the end, Corbin ended up becoming the man the wanted to be. In closing, he says: \"I don\'92t have a \'91Plan B\'92, I\'92m giving it all for my dreams. For the first time in my life I can see where I want to go and how to get there.\'94 \fs25\fsmilli12800 \cf4 \strokec4 \\pard\pardeftab720\sl300\partightenfactor0\cf4 \\pard\pardeftab720\sl360\partightenfactor0\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 \strokec2 Download/Stream \'93Chapter One\'94 now! {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK \"http://fanlink.to/corbinhale\"}}{\fldrslt \cf6 \ul \ulc6 \strokec6 http://fanlink.to/corbinhale}}\fs25\fsmilli12800 \cf4 \strokec4 \}"
